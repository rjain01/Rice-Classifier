# Rice-Classifier

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset

The original dataset had 75K images including 15K pieces from each rice variety (Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag)

My Dataset

Train : 10K images with 2K pieces from each rice variety.

Validate : 2K images with 500 pieces from each rice variety.

Test : 2K images with 500 pieces from each rice variety.

Method Proposed 

Using MobileNet Architecture as base with imagenet weights and tuned artificial neural network on top.
